    <div>Roblox is an online game platform and game creation system developed by Roblox Corporation. It allows users to program games and play games created by other users. Created by David Baszucki and Erik Cassel in 2004 and released in 2006, the platform hosts user-created games of multiple genres coded in the programming language Lua. For most of Roblox's history, it was relatively small, both as a platform and a company, due to both co-founder Baszucki's lack of interest in press coverage and it being "lost among the crowd" in a large number of platforms released around the same time. </div>

        The McLaren Speedtail is an honest-to-goodness modern marvel. ... More of an homage to the original McLaren three-seater, the F1, this special (well, more special Speedtail) bears the name of the Albert Drive testing facility where the F1 was developed and built in the early '90s.

        Features of Hypercars
      </h1>
      <p> The term hypercar seems to be used more and more each year. We simply define a hypercar as a top-tier supercar that bests all or most of the elements of standard supercars including, but not limited to, acceleration, price, rarity, handling, top speed, sound and appearance.</p>
      <p> Making the car super-light, two to three times lighter than steel cars. making the car ultra-low drag, so that the car slips along several times more easily. using a smaller electric or hybrid engine to propel the much more energy efficient car.</p>
      <p> The LaFerrari is a monument to everything Ferrari does singularly well and still our reigning hypercar standard-bearer.
